		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>3 spoons of mustard</li>
			<li>Guerande salt</li>
			<li>30g of butter</li>
			<li>5 slices of bread</li>
			<li>250g of smoked bacon</li>
			<li>400g of onions</li>
			<li>1kg of lean beef</li>
			<li>1 spoon of brown sugar</li>
			<li>1 bouquet of garni</li>
			<li>1L of brown beer</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Preparation</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Cut the meat into cubes measuring 2 to 3 centimeters on each side.
				Roughly chop the onions and cut the bacon into large pieces.
			</li>
			<li>
				Melt the butter and sweat the onions in it for 10 minutes to soften them
				(low heat, covered).
			</li>
			<li>
				Add the bacon, increasing the heat slightly, stirring regularly, trying
				to keep it covered as much as possible.
			</li>
			<li>
				Once the bacon is nicely pink, remove everything (except the juice) and
				reserve it in a dish.
			</li>
			<li>
				Turn the heat to high and put the meat in the casserole. Stir regularly
				(do not cover), the meat should color on all sides, it will eventually
				release a lot of juice. Remove the casserole from the heat, put the meat
				in a dish, keeping the juice in the casserole.
			</li>
			<li>
				Dilute the brown sugar in the meat juice and put on high heat. to reduce
				it by half.
			</li>
			<li>
				Once reduced, put the mini on fire and add the bacon-onion mixture by
				mixing it with the 'syrup', add the meat and mix again, add the bouquet
				garni and cover with beer between (80 cl and 1 liter), salt very
				lightly.
			</li>
			<li>
				Gently cover the entire surface with the 'mustard' gingerbread. Leave to
				simmer covered for 3 hours without stirring, as long as the gingerbread
				has not melted (remove the bouquet after 1 hour or 2 maximum).
			</li>
			<li>While 'simmering', adjust the seasoning if necessary.</li>
			<li>
				If after three hours, the juice is still too liquid, let it simmer
				again, leaving the lid partly open; the sauce should be slightly sticky
				on the surface but very liquid underneath and should not burn at the
				bottom.
			</li>
		</ol>
